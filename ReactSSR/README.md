# React Server Side Rendering

A baseline for server side rendering for your React application. This repo has a couple of tags that follow building full support for rendering React applications on the server.

## Getting started

Clone the repo with

```bash

git clone https://github.com/hitao123/react-tutorial.git

cd ReactSSR

Install dependencies with

npm i

Run dev mode with

npm run dev
```

Now open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:20000` and you get your server rendered React app. You can inspect the page source and see that the html coming from your local server has all the nodes defined in the React app.
